# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A responsive, interactive **Tic Tac Toe game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the web.  
This classic two-player game is designed with a clean user interface, smooth gameplay, and real-time win/draw detection logic. It runs entirely in the browser and requires no backend.



## 🧾 Description

This project is a **web-based implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game**, designed for two players to play locally. The application features a **modern user interface**, responsive design, and intuitive gameplay logic. Players alternate turns to place their mark (❌ or ⭕) on a 3×3 grid, with the game automatically checking for win conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals) or a draw.

The game logic is written in **vanilla JavaScript**, ensuring lightweight performance with no external libraries. The interface is styled using **CSS3**, and the structure is built with **HTML5**, making the app accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive layout design — suitable for frontend web development portfolios.
